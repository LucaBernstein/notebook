## Flea Markets

* [Mauerpark](https://goo.gl/6wioq7): Open Sundays. One of the biggest and got a lot of furniture at the western side of the market. Should be close to your home. Got my dining table and chairs from here._

* [Flea market at RAW](https://goo.gl/rXnRbA): Sundays, morning till late afternoon. There's a huge 2nd hand / vintage furniture shop that always opens together with the flea market._

* [Flea market at Boxhagener Platz](https://goo.gl/maps/ZUcd6NweQZF2): Open on Sunday, very close to the RAW one but better before 3pm.

* [Berlin Hallenflohmarkt](https://goo.gl/7cfQWc): They are open several days of the week until 4pm. Quite big and lots of furniture. Some of the stuff maybe quite old and dusty but cheap (you've got to bargain though)_
