## 5 ways to build lasting self-esteem

Noted from [Ted Ideas](http://ideas.ted.com/5-ways-to-build-lasting-self-esteem)

Improving self-esteem requires a bit of work, as it involves developing and maintaining healthier emotional habits but doing so, and especially doing so correctly, will provide a great emotional and psychological return on your investment.

#### Use positive affirmations correctly

Ironically, positive affirmations do work for one subset of people — those whose self-esteem is already high. For affirmations to work when your self-esteem is lagging, tweak them to make them more believable. For example, change “I’m going to be a great success!” to “I’m going to persevere until I succeed!”

#### Identify your competencies and develop them

Self-esteem is built by demonstrating real ability and achievement in areas of our lives that matter to us.

#### Learn to accept compliments

The best way to avoid the reflexive reactions of batting away compliments is to prepare simple set responses and train yourself to use them automatically whenever you get good feedback (e.g., “Thank you” or “How kind of you to say”).

#### Eliminate self-criticism and introduce self-compassion

Whenever your self-critical inner monologue kicks in, ask yourself what you would say to a dear friend if they were in your situation and direct those comments to yourself.

#### Affirm your real worth

Make a list of qualities you have that are meaningful in the specific context.
