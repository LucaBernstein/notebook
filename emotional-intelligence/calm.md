# Calm

* We aren’t overwhelmed by anger whenever we are frustrated; only when we first believed ourselves entitled to a particular satisfaction and then did not receive it. Our furies spring from events that violate a background sense of the rules of existence.
* So we must learn to disappoint ourselves at leisure before events take us by surprise. We must be systematically inducted into the darkest realities—the stupidities of others, the ineluctable failings of technology, the eventual destruction of all that we cherish—while we are still capable of a relative measure of rational control.
* It is a psychological law that those who are most attracted to calm will almost certainly also be especially irritable and by nature prone to particularly high levels of anxiety.
* Typically, lovers of something are not the people who already possess it but those who are hugely aware of how much they lack it—and are therefore especially humble before, and committed to, the task of securing it.
