## Ritual

* Ritual can be defined as the structured repetition of important concepts, made resonant through the help of formal pageantry and ceremony.
* Ritual takes thoughts that are known but unattended and renders them active and vivid once more in our distracted minds.
* Unlike standard modern education, ritual doesn’t aim to teach us anything new; it wants to lend compelling form to what we believe we already know.
* It wants to turn our theoretical allegiances into habits.
* The best rituals don’t so much impose upon us ideas that we are opposed to but take us back to ideas that we are in deep agreement with yet have allowed to lapse: They are an externally mandated route to inner authenticity.
