# Self-esteem

* Our degree of satisfaction is critically dependent on our expectations. The greater our hopes, the greater the risks of rage, bitterness, disappointment, and a sense of persecution. We are not always humiliated by failing at things; we are humiliated only if we first invested our pride and sense of worth in a given achievement and then did not reach it.
* “With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-esteem in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do,” wrote the psychologist William James. “It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities … thus:

```
              Success
Self Esteem = ————————————
              Expectations"
```
