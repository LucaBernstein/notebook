# Warm vs. Cold People

* From a touching modesty, the coldly polite believe in appearances. They trust that the outward respectability, composure, and self-possession of those they encounter must be more or less the whole truth about them.
* The warm, on the other hand, make a well-founded guess that those they encounter, despite the observable initial evidence, are not what they seem. They may look adult and composed, but the truth will be reassuringly more complicated.
* The warm know themselves well enough to walk past the surface presentation and assume that their own stranger selves will have echoes in the lives of others.
* The warmly polite person knows that beneath the competent surface everyone is clumsy, frightened, desirous, and fascinatingly unbalanced—and they bring this knowledge to bear in every encounter, whatever its outwardly forbidding nature.
* This knowledge prevents the warm person from being, at points, overfriendly or cheerful. They do not equate friendliness with a relentlessly upbeat tone. They know how much is sad and anxious in everyone. They don’t want to flatter us in ways that could raise the cost of revealing anything more despairing or confused. They leave the door open for a possible need to admit at pretty much any point to something highly shameful. They seem permanently ready to travel with us to the darker, more panicked sides of our minds.
* The good teaser aims to reform us, not through lectures, but by encouraging finely administered tart jokes at our surface selves.
