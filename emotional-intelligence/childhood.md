# Childhood

* Children can’t go elsewhere. They have no extended social network. Even when things are going right, childhood is a gentle open prison.

## Communication

* When something is very wrong, children have no innate capacity to explain its cause. They lack the confidence, poise, and verbal dexterity to get their points across with the calm and authority required.
* They tend to experience dramatic overreactions instead: insisting, nagging, exploding, screaming.
* Or else excessive under-reactions: sulking, sullen silence, avoidance.

## Development

* As children, when someone asked our age, we might have said, “I’m four”, and added, with great solemnity, “and a half.” We didn’t want anyone to think we were only four. We had traveled so far in those few months, but then again we were modest enough to sense that the huge dignity of turning five was still quite far away.
* In other words, as children, we were hugely conscious of the rapidity and intensity of human development and wanted clearly to signal to others and ourselves what dramatic metamorphoses we might undergo in the course of our ordinary days and nights.
* It would nowadays sound comic or a touch mad for an adult to say proudly, “I’m twenty-five and a half” or “forty-one and three-quarters”—because, without particularly noticing, we’ve drifted away from the notion that adults, too, are capable of evolutions.
* The focus is on what grades have been achieved, what career has been chosen and what progress has been made in the corporate hierarchy. Development becomes largely synonymous with promotion.

## Emotionally Healthy Childhood

* In an emotionally healthy childhood, someone will put themselves profoundly at our service. They (our parents) interpreted what we could not quite say, they guessed what might be ailing us, they settled and consoled us. They kept the chaos and noise at bay and cut the world up into manageable pieces for us.
* In an emotionally healthy childhood, we’re given the benefit of the doubt. We are assessed by what we might one day be, not by exactly what we are right now.
* In an emotionally healthy childhood, the relationship with our caregiver is steady, consistent, and long-term. We trust that they will be there tomorrow and the day after. They are boringly predictable.
* In an emotionally healthy childhood, we aren’t always required to be wholly good boys or girls. We are allowed to get furious and sometimes a bit revolting—at certain points to say “absolutely not” and “because I feel like it.”
* In an emotionally healthy childhood, our carer isn’t jealous of or competitive with us. They can allow themselves to be overtaken and superseded.
* In an emotionally healthy childhood, the child learns that things that break can be fixed.
* Importantly, in an emotionally healthy childhood, plenty goes wrong. No one has staked their reputation on rendering the whole story perfect.
* The carer does not see it as their role to remove every frustration.
* In an emotionally healthy childhood, the child can see that the good carer isn’t either entirely good or wholly bad and so isn’t worthy of either idealization or denigration.
* The child accepts the faults and virtues of the carer with melancholy maturity and gratitude—and in doing so, by extension, becomes ready to accept that everyone they like will be a mixture of the positive and the negative.
