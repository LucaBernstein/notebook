# Friendship

* Friendship is the dividend of gratitude that flows from an acknowledgment that one has offered something very valuable by talking: the key to one’s self-esteem and dignity.
* One of the most acute questions we ask ourselves in relation to new friends and acquaintances is whether or not they like us. The question feels so significant because, depending on how we answer it in our minds, we will either take steps to deepen the friendship or, as is often the case, immediately make moves to withdraw from it so as to spare ourselves humiliation and embarrassment.
* The good listener knows that we’d ideally move—via conversation with another person—from a confused, agitated state of mind to one that was more focused and (hopefully** more serene.
