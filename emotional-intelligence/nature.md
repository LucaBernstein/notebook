# Nature

* We are encouraged to imagine that we can, with time, create exactly the lives we desire, around our relationships, our work, and existence more generally. This hopeful scenario has been the source of extraordinary and unnecessary suffering.
* We will never be fully understood by others; we will always be burdened by primordial anxiety; we will never fully know what it is like to be someone else; we will invariably fantasize about more than we can have; we will realize that in key ways we cannot be who we would wish.
* Sometimes we respond quite negatively to encounters with things that are much larger and more powerful than ourselves. It’s a feeling that can strike us when we are alone in a new city, trying to negotiate a vast railway terminus or the huge subway system at rush hour, and we sense that no one knows anything about us or cares in the least for our confusion. The scale of the place forces upon us the unwelcome fact that we don’t matter in the greater scheme of things and that what is of great concern to us doesn’t figure at all in the minds of others. It’s a crushing, lonely experience that intensifies anxiety and agitation.
* There’s another way an encounter with the large-scale can affect us—and calm us down—that philosophers have called “the sublime.”

## The Sublime

* The sublime drags us away from the minor details that normally and inevitably occupy our attention and makes us concentrate on what is truly major.
* The encounter with the sublime undercuts the gradations of human status and makes everyone—at least for a time—look relatively unimpressive. Next to the mighty canyon or the vast ocean, even the celebrity or the CEO does not seem so mighty.
* Things happen on the scale of centuries. Today and tomorrow are essentially the same.
* Your existence is a small, temporary thing. You will die and it will be as if you had never been. I could sound demeaning. But these are generous sentiments when we otherwise so easily suffer by exaggerating our own importance. We are truly minute and entirely dispensable.
