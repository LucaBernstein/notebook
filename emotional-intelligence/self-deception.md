# Self-deception

We need to tell ourselves a little more of the truth because we pay too high a price for our concealments. We cut ourselves off from possibilities of growth.

On the other hand, humans are natural self-deceivers. Our techniques are multiple and close to invisible:

* We get addicted. Not necessarily to heroin or whisky, but to everyday innocuous activities that attract no alarm or suspicion. We are hooked on checking the news or tidying the house, exercising or taking on fresh projects at work.
* We are addicts whenever we develop a manic reliance on something—anything—to keep our darker and more unsettling feelings at bay.
* We lie by being very cheerful.
* We lie by attacking and denigrating what we love but haven’t managed to get.
* We lie through a generalized cynicism, which we direct at everything and everyone so as to ward off misery about one or two things in particular.
* We lie by filling our minds with impressive ideas that blatantly announce our intelligence to the world but subtly ensure that we won’t have much room left to rediscover long-distant feelings of ignorance or confusion upon which the development of our personalities may nevertheless rest.
* We deploy knowledge and ideas that carry indubitable prestige to stand guard against the emergence of more humble but essential knowledge from our emotional past.
* We lie by pretending that we are simpler than we actually are and that too much psychology might be nonsense. We lean on a version of robust common sense to ward off intimations of our own awkward complexity. We imply that not thinking very much is, at base, evidence of a superior kind of intelligence.
