# Self-knowledge

> Know yourself.
―  Socrates

* The journey to self-knowledge needs to begin with a better map of the terrain of [normality](./normality.md).
* Our sense of time is highly inaccurate, influenced chiefly by the novelty or familiarity of what happens rather than by strict chronological duration.
* We desire excessively and inaccurately.
* Our sexual drives wreak havoc on our sense of priorities. * Our whole assessment of the world can be transformed according to how much water we have drunk or the amount of sleep we have had.
* It’s immensely hard for us to think deeply and coherently for any length of time. We keep losing the thread. Competing, irrelevant ideas have a habit of flitting across the mental horizon and scrambling our tentative insights.
* Our sense of who we are allowed to be and what we can do is held prisoner by the shocks of the past.
* We each face calls, triggered by chance encounters with people, objects, or ideas, to change our lives.
* Something within us knows far better than our day-to-day consciousness permits us to realize the direction we need to go in in order to become whom we could really be.)
