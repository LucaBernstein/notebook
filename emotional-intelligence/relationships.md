# Relationships

* Far more than happiness, what motivates us in relationships is a search for familiarity—and what is familiar is not restricted to comfort, reassurance, and tenderness; it may include feelings of abandonment, humiliation, and neglect, which can form part of the list of paradoxical ingredients we need to refind in adult love.
* We are ready for relationships not when we have encountered perfection, but when we have grown willing to give flaws the charitable interpretations they deserve.
* A charitable mindset doesn’t make it lovely to be confronted by the other’s troubles. But it strengthens our capacity to stick with them, because we see that their failings don’t make them unworthy of love, rather all the more urgently in need of it.
* It’s very touching that we live in a world where we have learned to be so kind to children; it would be even nicer if we learned to be a little more generous toward the childlike parts of one another.

## Child-like Defensive Responses

* Our problems are often generated because we continue to respond to compelling people in the way we learned to behave as children around their templates.
* For instance, maybe we had a rather irate parent who often raised their voice. We loved them, but reacted by feeling that when they were angry we must be guilty. We got timid and humble. Now if a partner (to whom we are magnetically drawn) gets cross, we respond as squashed, browbeaten children: We sulk, we assume it’s our fault, we feel got at and yet deserving of criticism.
* Many of us are highly likely to end up with somebody with a particularly knotty set of issues that trigger our desires as well as our childlike defensive responses.
* The answer isn’t usually to shut down the relationship, but to strive to deal with the compelling challenges it throws up with some of the wisdom we weren’t capable of when we first encountered these in a parent or caregiver.


| A. Partner’s tricky behaviour | B. Childlike response |  C. More adult response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raising voice | "It's all my fault" | "This is their issue. I don't have to feel bad." |
| Patronizing | "I'm stupid" | "There are lots of kinds of intelligence. Mine is fine." |
| Morose | "I have to fix you" | "I'll do my best, but I'm not ultimately responsible for your mindset - and this doesn't have to impact on my self-esteem" |
| Overbearing | "I deserve this" | "I'm not intimidated by you" |
| Distracted, preoccupied | "Attention-seeking "Notice me" | "You're busy, I'm busy, that's ok** |

## Fear of rejection

* The assumption is that the terror of rejection will be limited in scope and focused on one particular stage of a relationship: its beginning. Once a partner is finally accepted and the union gets under way, the assumption is that the fear must come to an end.
* But one of the odder features of relationships is that, in truth, the fear of rejection never ends. It continues, even in quite sane people, on a daily basis, with frequently difficult consequences—chiefly because we refuse to pay it sufficient attention and aren’t trained to spot its counter-intuitive symptoms in others. We haven’t found a winning way to keep admitting just how much reassurance we need.
* Within established relationships, when the fear of rejection is denied, two major symptoms tend to show up.
* First, we may become distant—or what psychotherapists call “avoidant.”
* We grow into avoidant patterns when, in childhood, attempts at closeness ended in degrees of rejection, humiliation, uncertainty, or shame that we were ill-equipped to deal with.
* Or else we become controlling—or what psychotherapists calls “anxious.” We grow suspicious, frantic, and easily furious in the face of the ambiguous moments of love; catastrophe never feels too far away.

## Love and Education

* To love someone is, according to Romantic philosophy, quite simply to love them as they are, without any wish to alter them.
* What do we do with what we perceive as their weaknesses, the problems and regrettable aspects? The Greek idea of love turns to a notion to which we desperately need to rehabilitate ourselves: education. For the Greeks, given the scale of our imperfections, part of what it means to deepen love is to want to teach—and to be ready to be taught. Two people should see a relationship as a constant opportunity to improve and be improved. When lovers teach each other uncomfortable truths, they are not abandoning the spirit of love. They are trying to do something very true to genuine love, which is to make their partners more worthy of admiration.
* We should stop feeling guilty for simply wanting to change our partners and we should never resent our partners for simply wanting to change us.
* The good teacher knows that timing is critical to successful instruction. We tend automatically to try to teach a lesson the moment the problem arises, rather than when it is most likely to be attended to (which might be several days later).
* And so we typically end up addressing the most delicate and complex teaching tasks just at the point when we feel most scared and distressed and our student is most exhausted and nervous.
* When teaching and learning fail, we enter the realm of nagging.
* Lamentably, it doesn’t work. Nagging breeds its evil twin, shirking. The other pretends to read the paper, goes upstairs and feels righteous.
* The solution to nagging isn’t to give up trying to get others to do what we want. Rather, it is to recognize that persuasion always needs to be couched in terms that make intuitive sense to those we want to alter.

## Arguing well

* An average couple will have between thirty and fifty significant arguments a year, “significant” meaning an encounter that departs sharply from civilized norms of dialog, would be uncomfortable to film and show friends, and might involve screaming, rolled eyes, histrionic accusations, slammed doors, and liberal uses of terms like “asshole” and “dickhead.”
* A number of qualities are required to ensure that a couple know how to argue well.
* First and foremost, the need for each party to be able to pinpoint sources of discomfort in themselves early and accurately: to know how to recognize what they are unhappy about and what they need in order to flourish in the couple.
* One might need to wait until some of the surface tension has dissipated; perhaps the next morning can do just as well. One needs a background confidence not to have to blurt out every objection in a panicked diatribe or shout a wounded feeling across the room when the other is themselves too upset to hear it. One needs to know how to formulate one’s complaints into a convincing, perhaps even humorously framed point that has a chance of winning over its target.

## Complaining well

* Complaining well requires an impression that not everything depends on the complaint being heard perfectly. Were the lesson to go wrong, were the other to prove intransigent, one could survive and take one's love elsewhere. Not everything is at stake in an argument.
* To guide us in our restorative complaints, we might consider the following range of prompts:

* I sometimes feel frustrated with you when ...
* I’d love you to realize that you hurt me when ...
* One of the hardest things for you to understand about me is ...
* What I’d love you to appreciate about me is ...
* Where I’m unfulfilled in my life ...

## Affairs

* An affair is a love—or sexual—story between two people, one of whom (at least) is ostensibly committed to someone else.
* Once an affair has been uncovered, we often ask—in the position of the betrayed, pained party—when it began. Pinpointing the precise moment promises to shed light on its motivations and on possible ways to prevent any further such calamities in the future.
* This kind of detective work feels obvious, but it overlooks a complexity: The start of an affair should not be equated with the moment when two straying people meet.
* The affair pre-dates, possibly by many years, the arrival of any actual lover.

Signs of heading to affairs:

* Unending busy-ness
* Neglect
* Shaming
* Ownership
* Flirting
* One too many arguments
* Lack of tenderness
* Erotic disengagement
