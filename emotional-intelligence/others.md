# Others

* One of the fundamental paths to sympathy is the power to hold on, in the most challenging situations, to a distinction between a person’s overt unpleasant actions and the more pitiable motives that may underlie them. Pure evil is seldom at work. Almost all our worst moments can be traced back to an unexotic, bathetic, temptingly neglected ingredient: pain.
* People are bad, always, because they are in difficulty. They slander, gossip, denigrate, and growl because they are not in a good place.

## Frank People vs. Polite People

|  | Frank | Polite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seeing themselves | Child-like optimism | Suspicion |
| Seeing others | Like themselves | Quite different internally |
| Seeing others' ego | Internally robust | Need respect and love as much as cash |
| Reactions | Confident to make quick judgments | Unsure |

* Frank people believe in the importance of expressing themselves honestly principally because they trust that what they happen to think and feel will always prove fundamentally acceptable to the world.
* In this sense, the frank person sees themselves a little in the way we typically see small children: as blessed by an original and innate goodness.
* Tellingly, we don’t usually think that the strictures of politeness apply to the very young. We remain interested to hear about whatever may be passing through their minds and stay unalarmed by their awkward moments, infelicities, or negative statements.
* The frank person taps into just this childlike optimism in their uninhibited approach to themselves. Their trust in their basic purity erodes the rationale for editing or self-censorship.
* The polite person, by contrast, proceeds under a grave suspicion of themselves and their impulses. They sense that a great deal of what they feel and want really isn’t very nice. They are indelibly in touch with their darker desires and can sense their fleeting wishes to hurt or humiliate certain people.
* Paradoxically, the polite person who is pessimistic about their own nature doesn’t in fact end up behaving horribly with anyone. So aware are they of their own dislikeable sides, they nimbly minimize their impact upon the world.
* It is their extraordinary suspicion of themselves that helps them to be—in everyday life—uncommonly friendly, trustworthy and kind.
* The frank person operates with a charming, unconscious assumption that other people are at heart pretty much like them. This can make them very clubbable and allows them to create some astonishing intimacies across social barriers at high speed.
* For their part, the polite person starts from the assumption that others are highly likely to be in quite different places internally, whatever the outward signs.
* The frank person works with an underlying sense that other people are internally for the most part extremely robust. Those around them are not felt to be forever on the verge of self-doubt and self-hatred. Their egos are not assumed to be gossamer thin and at perpetual risk of deflating. There is therefore understood to be no need to broadcast constant small signals of reassurance and affirmation.
* The frank person assumes that everyone’s ego is already at least as big and strong as it should be. They are even likely to suspect that if you praise someone for the little things, you’ll only inflate their self-regard to undue and dangerous proportions.
* Yet the polite person knows that we take a lot of ourselves into our jobs and need to find respect and a form of love from them as much as we need cash.
* The polite person also cares passionately about spreading kindness, love, and goodness on a mass scale, but they are cautious about the chances of doing so on any realistic time horizon.
* The frank person has a high degree of confidence as to their ability to judge relatively quickly and for the long term what is right and wrong about a given situation.
* The polite person is much more unsure on all these fronts. They are conscious that what they feel strongly about today might not be what they end up thinking next week.
