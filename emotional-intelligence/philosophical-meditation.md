# Philosophical Meditation

* In “philosophical meditation,” instead of being prompted to sidestep our worries and ambitions, we are directed to set aside time to untangle, examine, and confront them.
* Key to the practice is regularly to turn over three large questions:
  * What am I anxious about right now?
  * What am I upset about right now?
  * What am I ambitious and excited about right now ?
