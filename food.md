* tomato and eggplant are technically fruits
* banana grows from a flower with a single ovary, so it is actually a berry.
* strawberry, which grows from a flower with several ovaries, isn’t a berry at all but an aggregate fruit

## fig

From [Love the Fig](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/love-the-fig)

* Fig is enclosed flowers that bloom modestly inward, unlike the flamboyant showoffs on other plants. Bite a fig in half and you’ll discover a core of tiny blossoms.
* Because a fig is actually a ball of flowers, it requires pollination to reproduce, but, because the flowers are sealed, not just any bug can crawl inside.
* That task belongs to a minuscule insect known as the fig wasp, whose life cycle is intertwined with the fig’s. Mother wasps lay their eggs in an unripe fig. After their offspring hatch and mature, the males mate and then chew a tunnel to the surface, dying when their task is complete. 
* The females follow and take flight, riding the winds until they smell another fig tree.
* When the insects discover the right specimen, they go inside and deposit the pollen from their birthplace.
* Then the females lay new eggs, and the cycle begins again.
