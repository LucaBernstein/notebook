# Highlights

* Not only management and authority, power and wealth, but also data and knowledge are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, and a growing number of citizens feel left out, not so much forgotten as never noticed in the first place.
* As their disillusionment deepens, so does the distrust even in the most basic institutions.
* To be deprived of a voice means to be deprived of agency over our own lives. It also means to slowly but systematically become alienated from our own journeys, struggles and inner transformations, and begin to view even our most subjective experiences as though through someone else's eyes, an external gaze.
* Stories bring us together, untold stories keep us apart.
* We are made of stories - those that have happened, those that are still happening at this moment in time and those that are shaped purely in our imagination through words, images, dreams and endless sense of wonder about the world around us and how it works.
* Unvarnished truths, innermost reflections, fragments of memory, wounds unhealed. Not to be able to tell your story, to be silenced and shut out, therefore is to be dehumanized. It strikes at your very existence, it makes you question your sanity, the validity of your version of events. It creates a profound, and existential anxiety in us.
* In losing our voice something in us dies.
* When you feel alone don't look within, look out and look beyond for others who feel the same way, for there are always others, and if you can connect with them and with their story, you'll be able to see everything in a new light.
* If wanting to be heard is one side of the coin, the other side is being willing to listen. The two are inextricably connected. When convinced that no one -especially those in places of power and privilege- is really paying attention to our protests and demands we'll be less inclined to listen to others, particularly to people whose views differ from ours. Communication across the cultural and ideological spectrum will falter and eventually, crumble. And when communication is broken, coexistence, inclusion and social harmony will also be damaged. In other words, if perpetuated and made routine, the feeling of being systematically unheard will slowly, gradually, seal our ears, and then seal our hearts.
* The moment we stop listening to diverse opinions is also when we stop learning. Because the truth is we don't learn much from sameness and monotony. We usually learn from differences.
* The thing about groupthink or social media bubbles is that they aggressively feed and amplify repetition. And repetition, however familiar and comforting, will never challenge us mentally, emotionally and behaviorally.
* Echoes simply reiterate what simply reiterate what has already been said at some point in time, long gone. Like dead stars, they might seem to have a presence from a distance, but in truth, they are completely devoid of life and light. Echo chambers, therefore, severely limit the breadth and depth of the views we subject ourselves to, they ration knowledge. And at the same time, they limit wisdom: wisdom, which connects the mind and the heart, activates emotional intelligence, expands empathy and understanding, allows us to reach beyond the lonely confines of our own minds and engage with the rest of humanity, to listen them and learn from them.
* We must strive to become intellectual nomads, keep moving, keep learning, resist confining ourselves in any cultural or mental ghetto, and spend more time not in select centers but at the margins, which is where real change always come from.
* In a world that is profoundly complex and challenging, group narcissism has become a compensation for our personal frustrations, flaws and failures. But above all, it provides a counterbalance to two troubling feelings; disillusionment and bewilderment.

## Disillusionment And Bewilderment

> The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.
â€•  Antonio Gramsci

* To be parrt of a collective feels more anchored, less anxiety-inducing,. This is what Erich Fromm highlighted when he explained how an individual, after being afflicted with insecurity and vulnerability, aspires to gain a new sense of safety and self worth by equating himself / herself with a large body of people.
* Whether in public or digital spaces nuanced debates are not welcome any more. Instead, there are clashing certainties. Media panels often exacerbate dualities.
* Feeling systematically unheard, unsupported and unappreciated can make me painfully resentful, and abiding resentment will probably turn me into a reluctant listener. If and when I am a reluctant listener, I will also become a poor learner. I will interact less and less with theories and opinions that do not agree with mine.


## Anger

* Anger in the face of injustice and oppression is not only a dignified human response but often the antithesis of indifference. Anger is also the emotion with the longest memory.
* Anger can also easily turn repetitive, intransigent, corrosive. Equally, it can be a paralytic emotion. It's as if the intensity of it is enough to persuade the person feeling it that they've done enough - or else, it might keep you in a state of brooding and obsessing over the wrong without being able to move forward, to find a way to heal the wrong. Unless we manage to channel anger in to more productive, calmer but not necessarily less intense force, it runs the risk of becoming highly combustible and blindly destructive, burning through buildings and bridges and human connections, burning in vicious cycle in which violence begets more violence. We can not let that happen.

## Apathy

* Just as the color white is a combination of all colors, apathy is combination of many emotions: anxiety, disillusionment, bewilderment, fatique, resentment... mix them fast, mix them hard and you end up with pervasive paralysis, lack of feeling and numbness.

## Information, Knowledge and Wisdom

* We live in an age in which there is too much information, less knowledge and even less wisdom. That ratio needs to be reversed. We definitely need less information, more knowledge and much more wisdom.
* Knowledge requires reading. Books. In depth analyses. Investigative journalism. Then there is wisdom, which connects the mind and the heart, activates emotional intelligence, expands empathy. For that, we need stories and story telling.
* Perhaps in an era when everything is in constant flux, in order to be more sane, we need a blend of conscious optimism and creative pessimism.
* Don't be afraid of complexity.
* Be afraid of people who promise an easy shortcut to simplicity.
* Analyze, understand and reflect upon where negative emotions come from, embrace them candidly, but also notice if and when they become repetitive, restrictive, ritualistic and destructive.
