## Highlights

### Preface

* Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1.
* Humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles technology.
* The single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.

### The Challenge of the Future

* In the most minimal sense, the future is simply the set of all moments yet to come. But what makes the future distinctive and important isn’t that it hasn’t happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today. In this sense, if nothing about our society changes for the next 100 years, then the future is over 100 years away.
* There is no reason why technology should be limited to computers. Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology.
* In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.
* New technology tends to come from new ventures—startups. From the Founding Fathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild Semiconductor’s “traitorous eight” in business, small groups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.
* A lone genius might create a classic work of art or literature, but he could never create an entire industry.
* Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can. Positively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.

### Party Like It's 1999

* “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad).
* The backdrop for the short-lived dot-com mania that started in September 1998 was a world in which nothing else seemed to be working. The Old Economy couldn’t handle the challenges of globalization. Something needed to work—and work in a big way—if the future was going to be better at all. By indirect proof, the New Economy of the internet was the only way forward.

Lessons Learned from Dot-com Bust:

* *Make incremental advances:* Grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged.
* *Stay lean and flexible:* All companies must be "lean" which is code for "unplanned". You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead, you should try things out, "iterate," and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.
* *Improve on the competition:* Don't try to create a new market prematurely. 
* *Focus on product, not sales:* If your product requires advertising or sales people to sell it, it's not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.

These lessons have become dogna in the startup world; those would ignore them are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. 
And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:

* It's better to risk boldness than triviality.
* A bad plan is better than no plan.
* Competitive markets destroy profits.
* Sales matters just as much as product.

* We still need new technology, and we may even need some 1999-style hubris and exuberance to get it. To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon the dogmas created after the crash. That doesn’t mean the opposite ideas are automatically true: you can’t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting them.
* The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

### All Happy Companies Are Different

* Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create.
* “Perfect competition” is considered both the ideal and the default state in Economics 101. So-called perfectly competitive markets achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets consumer demand. Every firm in a competitive market is undifferentiated and sells the same homogeneous products. Since no firm has any market power, they must all sell at whatever price the market determines. If there is money to be made, new firms will enter the market, increase supply, drive prices down, and thereby eliminate the profits that attracted them in the first place. If too many firms enter the market, they’ll suffer losses, some will fold, and prices will rise back to sustainable levels. Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.
