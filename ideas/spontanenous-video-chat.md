# Spontaneous Video Chat

The modern day remote work with video and audio chat software is designed to be complimentary tools for meetings, and this design limitation drives users to split their energy and attention into multiple software not meant to play well together. As more people work remotely, our need evolved from a video streaming tool for given meeting at given time to a communication tool that brings people together and helps us build culture, while still working remote.

I imagine a communication software which we open to start our work and close when we're done. In between, we can watch the video (or audio) conversations happening if they're made publicly and join them if we want to. We could tap somebody and start talking immediately if they marked themselves as available.

The difference would be, we'd gather the whole company in one group while letting people have the conversations they'd like to based on their own agenda and context. The main difference of this way of communication is to eliminate calendar and meeting from video / audio communication and make them more spontaneous.
