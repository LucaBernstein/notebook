# Neural Networks

## What is a neural network?

* Imagine a 28x28 pixels picture of a handwritten digit.
* The network starts with 28x28=784 neurons. Each one of these takes a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel.
* Think of each neuron as a function. It takes the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer, and spits out a number between 0 and 1.
* The entire network is also just a function. It takes in N (e.g 784) numbers as an input and spits out 10 numbers.
