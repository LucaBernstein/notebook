Resillience is the ability to bounce back.

## Suggestions

* Use proactive thinking to categorize concerns and control impact to manage your resources / energy.
* We'll be more healthy and successful if we speak to ourself with more mindful self-compassion, less demanding and agression.

## What stops us ?

* Childhood development: how we respond to stress. We copy our behavior from parents.
* Core beliefs
* Ways of thinking and behaving

#### Subconscious Beliefs

* My worth is measured by competetive situations
* Everyone I work with must approve me all times
* I must prove myself and be seen to be a competent high performer of all times.

#### Spiralling Thought Patterns

* Catastrophizing
* If only thinking
* Blame
* Learned helplesness

## Self-distancing

5 self-distancing techniques:

* **Be the fly in the wall:** Sit in the wall and observe.
* **Thinking about yourself as a third person:** It sounds arrogant but it's helpful.
* **Writing:** One way of processing is to write. Make sense in larger story of your life.
* **What would future self say to you?**
* **How would someone you look up to respond to?** This will help you access your hidden knowledge and emulate better version of yourself.

| Self hatred & blame            | Moving on                           |



## Changing Our Mindset

> People are not disturbed by things, but by the views they take of them.
â€•  Epictetus

* Our mindset - the way we view or approach the world and life's problems - often determines our level of resilience, and thus how we cope with change and loss.
* The psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that developing more of a growth mindset can help us make fundamental  changes in our lives.
* A "Growth Mindset" is the belief that you have, or can gain, the tools to support you and help you move forward even in those times when you have no control over events.
* This way of thinking can be cultivated.
* A key step is to take responsibility without being too hard on ourselves: feeling bad about something can motivate us to rectify the situation or to change for better, whilst being too hard on ourselves can actually hold us back from acting.

## Understanding Your Resources

* **Strengths:** Humour, communication, flexibility
* **Strategies:** Asking for help, eating well, exercising, meditating, writing, spending time in nature
* **Resources:** Social, spiritual, educational, therapeutic.
* **Insithgs:** Sayings, ideas.

## Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset

|   | Fixed Mindset  | Growth Mindset  |
| --- | ---- | --- |
| **Skills**     | Something you're born with, fixed  | Comes from hard work, can always improve                          |
| **Challenges** | Something to avoid, could reveal lack of skill, tend to give up easily | Should be embraced, an opportunity to grow, more persistant  |
| **Effort**     | Unnecessary, something you do when you are not good enough  | Essential, a path to mastery                                      |
| **Feedback**   | Get defensive, take it personally  | Useful, something to learn from others, identify areas to improve |
| **Setbacks**   | Blame others, get discouraged  | Use as a wake up call to use a different approach next time       |
