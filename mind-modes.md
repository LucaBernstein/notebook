# Mind Modes

* Our habitual mode is doing. It's often our ally, but it can become our enemy.
* When we're stressed we tend to overuse the doing mode - worrying, analysing and problem solving.
* We habitually and unhelpfully turn to this mode to free ourselves from unwanted emotion, often leading to depression and anxiety.
* Doing mode is triggered by the discrepancy-based monitor, when we create an idea of how we want things to be or think they should be, and then compare that to how they are now.
* If there is discrepancy, we generate thoughts and actions to try to close the gap and keep monitoring our progress; adjusting, analyzing and checking accordingly.
