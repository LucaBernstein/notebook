# Communication Basics

My notes from Communication Training given by School of Life Berlin in 2019.

## Listening

A listener has 4 ways to react in a conversation;

* **The Killer:** Passive contructive. Distracted listening.
* **The Kidnapper:** Passive destructive. e.g talking about ourselves as a response.
* **The Joy Thief:** Active destructive. Negative & worried.
* **The Joy Multiplier:** Active constructive. E.g asking questions, showing genuine interest.

It's important to know when to invest energy and when to withdraw energy.

## Feedback

* It helps us to learn.
* It can hurt our ego or create an opportunity for learning.

#### Giving Feedback

* Check if feedback is wanted.
* Describe the situation
* Explain the impact
* Slow down and wait for questions / reactions
* Propose a solutions or way of improving the situation

#### Receiving Feedback

* Listen without interrupting
* Clarify any misunderstandings and disagreements
* Avoid arguing or becoming defensive
* Establish shared understanting
* Practise perspective taking

## Power and Relationship

* **Appease:** Saying "yes" when we want to say "no".
* **Attack:** We say no in a way that's not appropriate.
* **Avoid:** We don't say anything (fear).

#### The Positive "No**

* Explain and clarify yes
* Say No
* Suggest different say "yes**

## Difficult Conversations

The other person:

* Reserved and disinterested
* Closed, doesn't respond to arguments, critics, defensive about feedback
* Gives excuses, blaming others or circumstances
* Shows insecurity, sadness, self-doubt
* Becomes aggressive and attacks you
* Exaggerated friendliness, does everything to be liked
* Disputes everything you say

## The Line

```
open        curious           willing to learn
________________________________________________________
closed      defensive         concerned with being right
```


## Do / Don't


| Do                                                  | Don't          |
| ---                                                 | ---            |
| Allow the other person to say what they want to say | Blame, sarcasm |
| Paraphrasing                                        | Exaggeration   |
| Come back with question                             | Labelling, Interpretation |
| Create a safe space                                 | Gossip, insults, threats |

## 3 Different Conversations

* **Content Conversations:** What happened?
* **Feeling Conversations:** What emotions are involved?
* **Identity Conversations:** What does this say about me?
