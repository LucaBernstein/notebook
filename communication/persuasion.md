## 6 Principles of Persuasion

Source: Dr. Robert Cialdini

#### Reciprocity

Offer something first. Then ask for what you want.

#### Authority

In your area of expertise, find out what the "white coat" is.

#### Consistency

Stick to one message. Don't follow every trend.

#### Consensus

If you want to do something, show others doing it.

#### Scarcity

It might not be enough to talk about the benefits of your offer, you also need to point what people will lose if they fail to act.

#### Liking

The universal principle; people prefer saying yes to people they like. But, who do we like ? According to Cialdini, we like people

* who are similar to us
* who compliment us
* who cooperate with us towards a common goal.
