## 01: Context and Background

* We inhabit **time and space**. Our territories are spatio-temporal.
* What do you do when you don't know where you are? If you're a computer, you crash. If you're a human, you freeze, like a frozen rabbit when it thinks a fox is looking at it: **the prey response**.
* **A belief system** is a set of moral guidelines about how we should behave and perceive.
* We can't look at anything without a **hierarchy of value**. This hierarchy helps us decide what to look at.
* If everything is equally important or unimportant, it's **chaos**. A value system structures the way we perceive the world and also guide our actions as we act in accordance with our values.
* We have values that we may not know ourselves. We can tell that because sometimes we tell ourselves to study but we don't. We're not really in control of ourselves to any great degree.
* A productive society would match their belief systems and cooperate to get and give what they want to eachother. This would stop people from being anxious, make them happy and save them from **death anxiety**.
* If you think of territory as a domain where the fundamental presuppositions of each citizen are matched by the behavior of their co-citizens, people have reason to **defend** their territory.
* There might be more than one form of truth. **Pragmatic truth** is deeper than scientific truth.
* Pragmatic truth is the truths that enable you to act in a manner that best, improves the probability -rougly speaking- of your existence and your reproduction maximally.
* In most cultures, **music** plays a central role to **identity formation**. As we age, we'll find out that our favorite music that you listened to between the ages of 16 and 20. It defines a generation. Highly likely, in our tribal past, when you were inculcated into tribal culture, it was with dance, masks and music, all at same time. You were invited to take your place in the drama.
* Is the drama real? **Great dramas** are more than real. They are **hyperreal**; they provide guidelines about how to act. They're abstract, perhaps even generic; applicapable to broad range of situations.
* **Chaos** is the place you end up when what you're doing and the world stop matching.
* According to [Paglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Paglia); **articulate knowledge** is embedded in inarticulate knowledge. **Inarticulate knowledge** is domain of art and literature.
* [Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) believed that there was this domain we had mastered, and there was domain outside, which you can think of as **unexplored territory**. We try to figure out how to deal with the unexplored territory with our **creative imagination**. We're producing dramas that we could act out that would help us deal with what we still hadn't mastered.
* [Paglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Paglia)'s idea was that without understanding that **surround**, we're too atomized. We're not part of our **historical tradition**, we haven't incorporated the **spirit of our ancestors** who built all this. We're just here now; we don't know how to maintain our culture and serve it.
* People ask what the **meaning of life** is. It seems to me that, meaning is proportionate to the **adoption of responsibility**.
* Noone argues with their **pain**. So we could say, the ultimate reality is pain.
