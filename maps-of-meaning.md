## 01: Context and Background

* We inhabit **time and space**. Our territories are spatio-temporal.
* What do you do when you don't know where you are? If you're a computer, you crash. If you're a human, you freeze, like a frozen rabbit when it thinks a fox is looking at it: **the prey response**.
* **A belief system** is a set of moral guidelines about how we should behave and perceive.
* We can't look at anything without a **hierarchy of value**. This hierarchy helps us decide what to look at.
* If everything is equally important or unimportant, it's **chaos**. A value system structures the way we perceive the world and also guide our actions as we act in accordance with our values.
* We have values that we may not know ourselves. We can tell that because sometimes we tell ourselves to study but we don't. We're not really in control of ourselves to any great degree.
* A productive society would match their belief systems and cooperate to get and give what they want to eachother. This would stop people from being anxious, make them happy and save them from **death anxiety**.
* If you think of territory as a domain where the fundamental presuppositions of each citizen are matched by the behavior of their co-citizens, people have reason to **defend** their territory.
* There might be more than one form of truth. **Pragmatic truth** is deeper than scientific truth.
* Pragmatic truth is the truths that enable you to act in a manner that best, improves the probability -rougly speaking- of your existence and your reproduction maximally.
