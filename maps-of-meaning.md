* We inhabit time and space. Our territories are spatio-temporal. 
* What do you do when you don't know where you are? If you're a computer, you crash. If you're a human, you freeze, like a frozen rabbit when it thinks a fox is looking at it: the prey response.
* There might be more than one form of truth. Pragmatic truth is deeper than scientific truth. 
* Pragmatic truth is the truths that enable you to act in a manner that best, improves the probability -rougly speaking- of your existence and your reproduction maximally.
