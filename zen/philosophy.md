# Zen Philosophy

## Beginner's Mind (初心)

* If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.

## Creation

There are 3 kinds of creation:

* **Universe:** When you are there, everything else is there; everything is created all at once. When we emerge from nothing, when everything emerges from nothing, we see it all as a fresh new creation. This is nonattachment.
* **Productivity:** Cooking food or tea, building a furniture...
* **Ourself:** Creating within yourself, Education, culture..

## Time 

> Time goes from present to past.
— Dōgen-zenji

* Moment after moment each one of us repeats this activity. Here there is no idea of time or space. Time and space are one. You may say, “I must do something this afternoon,” but actually there is no “this afternoon.” We do things one after the other. That is all.

## Practice

* When we practice zazen we limit our activity to the smallest extent.
* When you bow, you should just bow; when you sit, you should just sit; when you eat, you should just eat. If you do this, the universal nature is there.

## Communication

> When you say something to someone, he may not accept it, but do not try to make him understand it intellectually. Do not argue with him; just listen to his objections until he himself finds something wrong with them.
— Dōgen-zenji

* When you listen to someone, you should give up all your preconceived ideas and your subjective opinions; you should just listen to him, just observe what his way is. We put very little emphasis on right and wrong or good and bad. We just see things as they are with him, and accept them.
* Usually when you listen to some statement, you hear it as a kind of echo of yourself. You are actually listening to your own opinion.
