## Ten Prohibitory Precepts

* Not to kill. 
* Not to steal. 
* Not to misuse sex.
* Not to make false statements. 
* Not to sell or buy alcohol.
* Not to discuss the faults of other home-leaver bodhisattvas. 
* Not to praise yourself and insult others.
* Not to withhold dharma treasure. 
* Not to be angry.
* Not to slander the three treasures. 

P.S Loving fame is worse than breaking a precept.
