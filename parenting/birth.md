## Birth

Our baby is one week old by now. Here is what I learnt so far;

* Infants can detect light but can not "see" first 2 weeks. They'll be able to make eye contact and focus on objects by the end of month.
* They need sun bathing every day at least for 30 minutes between 6am until 9am.
* Swaddling is not beneficial according to the experts.
* They need milk every 2 hours and they'll cry until you feed them. 
* When baby is crying and you want to make him/her feel comfortable, try [burping](https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1051322/how-to-burp-your-baby).
* Even normal birth is bloody like a surgery. The mother will keep having painful contractions and will need a lot of rest after birth, so the father has to be ready for hard work and sleepless nights. 
* Disposable diapers are comfortable for baby because they can keep sleeping after peeing, so the parents, too. But they're expensive. We use clothe diapers and wake up & change when the baby pee/poo, and do laundry every day.
