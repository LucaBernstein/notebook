# Pronounciation

## Basics

#### Syllables

When a word has more than two syllables, one of them is going to be stressed. 

#### `t` -> `d`

`T` between two vowels are pronounced as `d`:

* `water` -> `waadr`
* `butter` -> `budr`

#### `[n] t [vowel]`

A `t` between an `n` and a vowel gets removed.

* `dentist` -> `dendist` 
* `international` -> `inernational`

## C + V

When a word ends with a consanant and is followed by a word that starts with a vowel sound, the speaker should push that consonant forward and connect it to the next word. 

* `drop it` -> `dro pit`
* `stop it` -> `STA pit`
* `I need it` -> `I nee dit` 
* `Play a song` -> `Pla ya song`
* `Read a book` -> `Rea da book`

### C + C

When a word ends with a consonant and the following word begins with a same or similar consonant sound, you'll only pronounce that sound once, by lenghening or holding the sound.

* `book club` -> `booklub`
* `best time` -> `bestime`
* `good day` -> `gooday`
* `sit down` -> `sidown`

## Linking

* `this orange` -> `thissorange`
* `this afternoon` -> `thissafternoon`
* `is he busy?`  -> `izibizi?`
* `cats or dogs?`  -> `catserdogs?`
* `what are you going to do?` -> `whaddya gonna do?`

Turn `T` into `D` sound when it becomes between two vowels:

* `that orange` -> `tha[d]orange`

## Intrusion 

Intrusion sounds makes it easier to pronounce two words;

* `/j/` 
* `/w/`
* `/r/`

#### `/j/` Examples: 


* `he asked` -> `heyaskt`
* `she answered` -> `sheyansrd`

#### `/w/` Examples:

* `do it` -> `dewit`
* `go out` -> `gowout`
* `put your shoe on` -> `put your shoewon` 

## Ellision

Usually `/t/` or `/d/` phoneme sound.

* `next door` -> `nexdoor`
* `dad take me to school` -> `datakeme` 
* `diamond ring` -> `diamonring` 
* `most common` -> `moscommon`

## Assimilation

Two sounds blend together.

`/t/` +`/y/` = `ch (ç)`

* `don't you` -> `doncha`
* `won't you` -> `woncha`
* `wouldn't` -> `wouldnchu` 
* `meet you` -> `meetchu` 
* `did you` -> `didja` 
* `would you` -> `wouldja` 

## Gemenese 

* `social life` -> `socialife`
* `pet turtle` -> `peturtle`

## Voiced / Unvoiced Consonants

Voiced consonants would vibrate your throat when pronounced, while unvoiced not. 

* **Unvoiced:** Ch, F, K, P, S, Sh, T, and Th (as in "thing")
* **Voiced:** B, D, G, J, L, M, N, Ng, R, Sz, Th (as in the word "then"), V, W, Y, and Z.

## Past Tense

#### `did` / `dıd`

When the word ends with `t` or `d`, pronounce it as `dıd`:

* `started` -> `star/dıd/`
* `invited` -> `invite/dıd`
* `expected` -> `expec/did`
* `visited` -> `visi/dıd`
* `edited` -> `edi/dıd` 
* `ended` -> `en/did`
* `decided` -> `deci/dıd`
* `needed` -> `nee/did`

#### `t`

Words ending with unvoiced consanants cause `ed` ending to be pronounced as `t`:

* `walked` -> `waakt`
* `talked` -> `taakt` 
* `watched` -> `watch/t/` (voiceless)
* `asked` -> `askt` 
* `shopped` -> `shopp/t/`
* `coughed` -> `cough/t/`

#### `d`

* `rained` -> `rain/d/`
* `showed` -> `show/d/`
* `planned` -> `plann/d/`
* `bobbed` -> `bob/d/`
* `loved` -> `lov/d/`
* `begged` -> `beg/d/`
* `breathed` -> `breet/d/`

#### `ıd`

* `demanded` -> `deman/ded`
