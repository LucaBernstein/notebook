# Lower Quadrant Vowels

This is a poem that highlights the lower quadrant vowels, in a minimal pair set.

```
Betty Botter bought some butter.
But, she said, the butter’s bitter.
If I put it in my batter, it will make my batter bitter,
But a bit of better butter will make my batter better,
So ‘twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter.
```
