# Basics

## the

If the following word starts with a consonant, it's pronounced as `dı`, if not, `di`. 

* `the office` -> `di office`
* `the country` -> `dı country`

## H-Droppping

Native English speakers connect their speech by deleting the [h] sound at the beginning of function words.

* `Did he get it?` -> `Diddy get it?`
* `I want him to call me` -> `I wanim to call me`
* `That's his choice` -> `Thatsiz choice`
* `She asked her to leave` -> `She astur to leave`
* `It has 8 legs` -> `Idaz 8 legs`
* `We have a lot to do today` -> `Wiyav a lot to do today`

## R-colored vowels

A vowel before an `R` becomes `err`:

* `first`: `ör` (Monothong)
* `fever`: `ır` / `er` (Monothong)
* `fear`: `iır` (Diphthong)
* `fare`: `air` (Diphthong)
* `far`: `ar` (Diphthong)
* `for`: `or` (Diphthong)
* `fire`: `ayr` (Triphtong)

## Syllables

When a word has more than two syllables, one of them is going to be stressed. 

## `t` -> `d`

`T` between two vowels are pronounced as `d`:

* `water` -> `waadr`
* `butter` -> `budr`

## `[n] t [vowel]`

A `t` between an `n` and a vowel gets removed.

* `dentist` -> `dendist` 
* `international` -> `inernational`
* `twenty` -> `twenii`
* `interstate` -> `inerstate`
* `don't know` -> `donnow`


## C + V

When a word ends with a consanant and is followed by a word that starts with a vowel sound, the speaker should push that consonant forward and connect it to the next word. 

* `drop it` -> `dro pit`
* `stop it` -> `STA pit`
* `I need it` -> `I nee dit` 
* `Play a song` -> `Pla ya song`
* `Read a book` -> `Rea da book`

## C + C

When a word ends with a consonant and the following word begins with a same or similar consonant sound, you'll only pronounce that sound once, by lenghening or holding the sound.

* `book club` -> `booklub`
* `best time` -> `bestime`
* `good day` -> `gooday`
* `sit down` -> `sidown`
