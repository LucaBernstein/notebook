# SCARF

*Notes from [SCARF: a brain-based model for collaborating with and influencing others](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/thurs_georgia_9_10_915_covello.pdf).*

## Intro

* Much of our motivation driving social behavior is governed by an overaching organizing principle of minimizing threat and maximizing reward.
* Several domains of social experience draw upon the same brain networks used for primary survival needs. Social needs are treated in much the same way in the brain as the need for food and water. 
* The SCARF model summarizes these two themes within a framework that captures the common factors that can activate a reward or threat response in social situations. This model can be applied in any situation where people collaborate in groups, including all types of workplaces, educational environments, family settings and general social events. 
* The SCARF model involves five domains of human social experience: Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness.
* This model enables people to more easily remember, recognize and potentially modify the core social domains that drive human behavior. Labelling and understanding these drivers draws conscious awereness to otherwise non conscious processes, which can help in two ways.
  * Firstly, knowing the drivers that can cause a threat response enables people to design interactions to minimize threats.
  * Secondly, knowing about the drivers that can activate a reward response enables people to motivate others more effectively by tapping into internal rewards, thereby reducing the reliance on external rewards such as money.

### Foundations of the SCARF model

* If a stimulus is associated with positive emotions or rewards, it will likely to lead to an approach response; if it is associated
with negative emotions or punishments, it will likely lead to an avoid response. The response is particularly strong
when the stimulus is associated with survival. 
* Studies show that the approach-avoid response drives attention at a fundamental level - nonconsciously, automatically and quickly. It's a reflexive activity.

| Response | Synonyms in literature | Which traditional primary factors activate the response | What social factors/situations activate the response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Approach** | Advance, attack, reward, resource, expand, solution, strength, construct, engage. | Rewards in form of money, food, water, sex, shelter, physical assets for survival | Happy, attractive faces. Rewards in the form of increasing status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, fairness. |
| **Avoid** | Withdraw, retreat, danger, threat, contract, problem ,weakness, deconstruct. | Punishment in the form of removal of money or other resources or threats like a large hungry predator or a gun | Fearful, unattractive, unfamiliar faces. Threats in the form of decreasing status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, fairness |

### The effects of approaching versus avoiding

* Someone feeling threatened by a boss who is undermining their credibility is less likely to be able to solve complex problems and more likely to make mistakes.
* The reduced cognitive performance is driven several factors. 
  * Firstly, when a human being senses a threat, resources available for overall executive functions in the prefontal cortex decrease. There is a strong negative correlation between the amount of threat activation and the resources available for prefrontal cortex. 
    * The result is literally less oxygen and glucose available for the brain functions involved in working memory, which impacts linear, conscious processing.
    * When feeling threatened by one's boss, it's harder to find smart answers because of diminished cognitive resources. 
  * Secondly, when threatened, the increased overall activation in the brain inhibits people from perceiving the more subtle signals required for solving non-linear problems, involved in the insight or "aha!" experience. 
  * Thirdly, with the amygdala activated, the dendency is to generalize more, which increases the likelihood of accidental connections. 
* The avoid response generates far more arousal in the limbic system, more quickly and with longer lasting effects than an approach response. This discovery that our brain is inherently attuned to threatening stimuli helps explain many disquieting parts of life, from why the media focuses on bad news to why people are self-critical. It also points to the need to understand the social nature of the brain and proactively minimize common social threats.
* The approach response (engagement) is a state of being willing to do difficult things, to take risks, to think deeply about issues and develop new solutions. An approach state is also closely linked to positive emotions. This state is one of increased dopamine levels, important for interest and learning.
