## Introduction

* Much of our motivation driving social behavior is governed by an overaching organizing principle of minimizing threat and maximizing reward.
* Several domains of social experience draw upon the same brain networks used for primary survival needs. Social needs are treated in much the same way in the brain as the need for food and water. 
* The SCARF model summarizes these two themes within a framework that captures the common factors that can activate a reward or threat response in social situations. This model can be applied in any situation where people collaborate in groups, including all types of workplaces, educational environments, family settings and general social events. 
* The SCARF model involves five domains of human social experience: Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness.
* This model enables people to more easily remember, recognize and potentially modify the core social domains that drive human behavior. Labelling and understanding these drivers draws conscious awereness to otherwise non conscious processes, which can help in two ways.
  * Firstly, knowing the drivers that can cause a threat response enables people to design interactions to minimize threats.
  * Secondly, knowing about the drivers that can activate a reward response enables people to motivate others more effectively by tapping into internal rewards, thereby reducing the reliance on external rewards such as money.

#### Foundations of the SCARF model

* If a stimulus is associated with positive emotions or rewards, it will likely to lead to an approach response; if it is associated
with negative emotions or punishments, it will likely lead to an avoid response. The response is particularly strong
when the stimulus is associated with survival. 
* Studies show that the approach-avoid response drives attention at a fundamental level - nonconsciously, automatically and quickly. It's a reflexive activity.

| Response | Synonyms in literature | Which traditional primary factors activate the response | What social factors/situations activate the response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Approach** | Advance, attack, reward, resource, expand, solution, strength, construct, engage. | Rewards in form of money, food, water, sex, shelter, physical assets for survival | Happy, attractive faces. Rewards in the form of increasing status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, fairness. |
| **Avoid** | Withdraw, retreat, danger, threat, contract, problem ,weakness, deconstruct. | Punishment in the form of removal of money or other resources or threats like a large hungry predator or a gun | Fearful, unattractive, unfamiliar faces. Threats in the form of decreasing status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, fairness |

#### The effects of approaching versus avoiding

* Someone feeling threatened by a boss who is undermining their credibility is less likely to be able to solve complex problems and more likely to make mistakes.
* The reduced cognitive performance is driven several factors. 
  * Firstly, when a human being senses a threat, resources available for overall executive functions in the prefontal cortex decrease. There is a strong negative correlation between the amount of threat activation and the resources available for prefrontal cortex. 
    * The result is literally less oxygen and glucose available for the brain functions involved in working memory, which impacts linear, conscious processing.
    * When feeling threatened by one's boss, it's harder to find smart answers because of diminished cognitive resources. 
  * Secondly, when threatened, the increased overall activation in the brain inhibits people from perceiving the more subtle signals required for solving non-linear problems, involved in the insight or "aha!" experience. 
  * Thirdly, with the amygdala activated, the dendency is to generalize more, which increases the likelihood of accidental connections. 
* The avoid response generates far more arousal in the limbic system, more quickly and with longer lasting effects than an approach response. This discovery that our brain is inherently attuned to threatening stimuli helps explain many disquieting parts of life, from why the media focuses on bad news to why people are self-critical. It also points to the need to understand the social nature of the brain and proactively minimize common social threats.
* The approach response (engagement) is a state of being willing to do difficult things, to take risks, to think deeply about issues and develop new solutions. An approach state is also closely linked to positive emotions. This state is one of increased dopamine levels, important for interest and learning.
* The SCARF model is an easy way to remember and act upon the social triggers that can generate both the approach and avoid responses. The goal if this model is to help minimize the easily activated threat responses, and maximize positive engaged states of mind during attempts to collaborate with and influence others.

## The SCARF Model

### Status

* Status is about relative importance, "pecking order" and seniority. Humans hold a representation of status in relation to others when in conversations, and this affects mental processes in many ways. 
* The perception of a potential or real reduction in status can generate a strong threat response. 

#### Reducing status threat
* It can be surprisingly easy to accidentally threaten someone's sense of status. A status threat can occur though giving advice or instructions or simply suggesting someone is slightly ineffective at a task. Many everyday conversations devolve into arguments driven by a status threat, a desire to not be perceived as less than another. When threatened, people may defend a position that doesn't make sense, to avoid the perceived pain of a drop in status.
* In most people, the question "can I offer you some feedback" generates a similar response to hearing fast footsteps behind you at night. 
* If leaders want to change others' behavior, more attention must be paid to reducing status threats when giving feedback. One way to do this by allowing people to give themselves feedback on their own performance.

#### Increasing status reward

* Organizations know all about using status as a reward and many managers feel compelled to reward employees primarily via a promotion. This may have the unfortunate side effect of promoting people to the point of their incompetence. The research suggests that status can be increased in more sustainable ways. 
* For example, people feel a status increase when they feel they are learning and improving and when attention is paid to this improvement. This probably occurs because individuals think about themselves using the same brain networks they use for thinking about others. For example, beating one's own best time at a task or sporting activity, the reward circuitry from a sense of being 'better than' is activated, but in this case, the person one is 'better than' is oneself in the past.
* Status can go up when people are given positive feedback, especially public acknowledgment. One study showed activation of the reward circuitry in children being as strong as money when told "That's correct" by a repetitive computer voice.
* Finally, status is about one's relative position in a community of importance such as a professional group or social club based on what is valued.
