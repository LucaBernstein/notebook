# Product Market Fit

#### Product Market Hypothesis

* A set of you can reach
* A problem to solve, for those specific people

is a possible try; a hypothesis.

#### Ideas

Good ideas are incredibly rare, and bad ideas are zeroes that nullify perfect execution. A lot of founders get stuck on this.

#### Common Failure Cases

* It's a real problem, can't get people to use it.
* It's not a real problem.

#### Customer Acquisition

The most common failure point is getting stuck doing same things that don't work; doing more of what doesn't work. Scalable success is finding something that works, then doubling down many times. You keep on doing that until you establish a new normal, a steady state, that is much bigger much bigger than where you were before. 

#### Pile of Pilots Problem

* Another failure mode here, is if you can get pilots, but the pilots don't expand. This is a real danger zone. That means that you haven't made something that really sticks. This is a well-known issue in digital health and biotech. We call it the pile of pilots problem. You can get a pile of pilots, but they're not going to expand. 

* When that happens, you have a seed company that cannot raise at Series A. 

* You need expansion. You need net retention. And if you can't, this isn't something people want. 

There are things you can do in this case. 

* You can improve your product. You can go directly to the people who are using it, and ask them, "Why aren't you using it?" Solve those problems, and you have another shot. That's a whole try. 
* Sometimes you have to go back to the product-market hypothesis, and change who you're solving this problem for. 
* You can change the price point.
* Sometimes really what you're doing there is picking a different problem to solve because that other set of people will have different needs. Needs that you might be able to fill with better software. 

#### Timeboxing

* You have a finite number of tries. If you timebox your tries, you'll get to try a lot more things. That will maximize your chances of success.
* Remember to timebox. Don't get stuck doing the same thing over and over again.

And here's where timeboxing comes into play. You need enough time to know either way. 

* **Too short**, and you may have given up on something that could have worked. 
* **Too long**, and you've wasted your time. You'll never get that time back. You've burned critical runway, in ways that have hurt you fundamentally. 

When you timebox, you set aside a specific amount of time to spend on this market and problem, and then, you quit. It's no use being a damned fool about it! That lets you go on to the next lead bullet. 

If you're a great team, if you're doing the right things, and you have this process, you're timeboxing, you're trying new things, you're firing new lead bullets, you can and will find product market fit. 

If it's not something people want, you have to do something else. 

Timeboxing is your way to be very conscious of how long you should spend on any given problem.
